DISCLAIMER:

    This software attempts to flash your Galaxy S device. The very nature of
    flashing is dangerous. As with all flashing software, Heimdall has the
    potential to damage (brick) your phone if not used carefully. If you're
    concerned, don't use this software. Flashing ROMs onto your phone may also
    void your warranty. I am not responsible for the result of your actions.



These instructions are for Linux operating systems.

Installing Heimdall from Source:

    1. First make sure you have installed build-tools and pkgconfig.

    2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory you extracted Heimdall to.

    3. Then enter the following commands to compile and install libusb-1.0:

            cd libusb-1.0
            ./configure
            make
            sudo make install

            make
            sudo make install
            cd ..

	    NOTE: You can use "checkinstall" instead of "make install" in order
                  to generate a redistributable package.

    5. If you're not installing from a package then copy
       60-heimdall-galaxy-s.rules
       into the udev rules directory (usually /etc/udev/rules.d/)

    6. Done

    3. Enter the following commands to compile and install Heimdall Frontend:

            cd heimdall-frontend
            qmake heimdall-frontend.pro
            make
            sudo make install

       NOTE: You can use "checkinstall" instead of "make install" in order to

Flashing Firmware with Heimdall Frontend:    

    1. Fully charge your device (use the wall charger as it's faster).

    2. Download a decrypted Samsung Galaxy S ROM and extract it to a directory.

    3. If the ROM is provided as one of more archives (nested or otherwise),
       extract them all to the same location.

       NOTE: If you want to use the CSC then extract it last.

    3. Open Heimdall Frontend.

    4. Put your Galaxy S device into download mode.

    5. For each file you wish to flash use "Browse" to select the file.

    6. Press "Start".

    7. Heimdall Frontend will display the progress and inform you when the
       flash is complete.



Flashing Firmware from Command Line / Terminal:
	
    1. Fully charge your device (use the wall charger as it's faster).

    2. Download a decrypted Samsung Galaxy S ROM and extract it to a directory.

       ROM files.

       Here is an example that does a full flash and repartition:
		
            heimdall flash --repartition --pit s1_odin_20100512.pit --factoryfs factoryfs.rfs --cache cache.rfs --dbdata dbdata.rfs --primary-boot boot.bin --secondary-boot Sbl.bin --param param.lfs --kernel zImage --modem modem.bin
