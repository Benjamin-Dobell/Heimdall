# Heimdall

Heimdall is a cross-platform open-source tool suite used to flash firmware (aka ROMs) onto Samsung mobile devices.

This is a fork of the original repository with a few crucial pull requests merged. 

## Supported Platforms

Officially, AMD64/x86-64 (64-bit) or x86 (32-bit) computers running:

 * Linux
 * macOS
 * Windows (XP, Vista, 7 etc.)

However, several third-parties have reported success running Heimdall on ARM chipsets
(in particular Raspberry Pi), as well as additional operating systems such as FreeBSD.

## How does Heimdall work?

Heimdall connects to a mobile device over USB and interacts with low-level software
running on the device, known as Loke. Loke and Heimdall communicate via the custom
Samsung-developed protocol typically referred to as the 'Odin 3 protocol'.

USB communication in Heimdall is handled by the popular open-source USB library, [libusb](http://libusb.info).

## Free & Open Source

Heimdall is both free and open source. It is licensed under the MIT license (see LICENSE).

Heimdall is maintained and predominantly developed by [Glass Echidna](http://glassechidna.com.au/),
a _tiny_ independent software development company. If you appreciate our work and would like
